# Cinnamon Stars

## Ingredients
- 6 egg whites
- 2 cups of white sugar
- 1 to 1.25 lbs unblanched almonds
- 2 tablespoons of cinnamon

## Other Needs
- Parchment paper
- Crisco
- Extra flour
- Extra sugar
- Star cookie cutter
- Wax paper

## Instructions

Grate almonds using a food processor and store in refrigerator until needed.

Beat egg whites until very stiff peaks achieved. Add sugar slowly to the egg whites, continue to beat until whites and sugar are stiff enough to hold shape.

By hand, using a flexible spatula, carefully fold in cinnamon, one tablespoon at a time, and almonds, 1/4 cup at a time, to create a soft dough.

In a separate small bowl, mix 1/2 a cup of sugar and 1/2 a cup of flour, and replenish as needed. On a clean board or surface, generously sprinkle the flour/sugar mixture.

Using your fingers, pat down mixture until it is about 1/4 inch thick. Dip star cookie cutter into the flour/sugar bowl and cut out cookies.

Cover a baking sheet in parchment paper and generously grease the parchment paper. Place star cookies on the greased parchment paper.

Preheat oven to 300° F. Place filled cookie sheets in the refrigerator for 15 minutes to thoroughly chill cookies. Bake at 300° F for 20 minutes. Use a stiff spatula to remove cookies. They may be light brown on the bottoms and edges.

Cool the cookies on wire racks. Once cooled, store in a crock with layers separated by wax paper.
