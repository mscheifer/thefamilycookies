# Ingredients
- 1.5 cups of white sugar
- 0.5 cups of all purpose flour
- 0.5 lbs of bakers chocolate
- 8 egg whites

# Other needs
- Parchment paper
- Wax paper
- Crisco

# Instructions
Place chocolate in freezer, when cold, break off pieces of chocolate and grate using a food processor or grinder. Store grated chocolate in the refrigerator until ready to use.

Using an electric mixer, beat egg whites until you achieve stiff peaks. By hand, using a flexible spatula, fold in slowly and carefully the sugar, then flour and chocolate, 1/4 cup at a time.

Preheat oven to 300°. Generously grease parchment paper to line baking sheets. Drop a heaping spoonful with space for the cookies to spread out. Bake at 300° for 18 minutes. Cookies may turn a light brown on edges and bottoms.

Using a stiff spatula, remove cookies and cool on wire racks. Once cooled, store in ceramic crocks lined with wax paper.
